SmartGPT is an experimental and open-source application designed to provide numerous LLMs with the ability to complete complex tasks without user input by breaking them down into subtasks.

# Why?

With so many projects designed similarly in the AI space, it may be a bit challenging to find the differences between them, so here, the differences can be described.

- **Modularity**: With first class plugin support, developers from all walks of life can design their own systems. That's right Jim, you can control your toaster.

- **Flexibility**: If you have a problem, you can probably configure it! Unlike other similar projects, SmartGPT has a highly configurable ecosystem in place which can be easily modified with a nifty [config.yml](config.example.yml).

- **Planning and Reasoning**: The boss-manager-employee style is a little less common, but its implementation will blow you away with its ability to develop complex thought processes. 

Regardless of these amazing facts, there are many shortcomings.

- **Experimental**: SmartGPT is incredibly experimental. The goal is to unlock the full potential of LLMs, and stability is a consequence of this. Groundbreaking changes are being made on the daily, and backwards compatibility is but a fever dream.

- **Ecosystem**: Due to its popularity, [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) is a very polished and refined tool. It has many more commands and integrations with memory systems. To go with this, the codebase has been through large scrutiny, so it is generally less buggy and more tested than SmartGPT.

- **Memory Management**: Due to the extreme youth of this project, there is only one simple but limited memory system. However, this will change with time.
